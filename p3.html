<p>As seen in the summary table of the regression, all explanatory
variables are significant. It is possible to say that as the floor of
the house increases, the rent increases by 1.8%. As a result, the houses
in the attic may have heating problems, which is out of this argument.
It is possible to say that as the floor of the house increases, the rent
increases by 1.8%. As a result, the houses in the attic may have heating
problems, which is out of this argument. In addition, you get away from
the noise of the street as the apartment you own is located on the upper
floors. You can have a better view and as long as you are not in the
attic, you will not have a heating problem as you will be on the
mezzanine. Such reasons may cause the rents of high-floor houses to be
higher.</p>
<p>If the house you want to rent is furnished, this increases its price
by approximately 11%. The result of the regression tells us this. The
reason for this is not so complicated. You pay more rent because you get
more services. When you rent a furnished house, you do not have to spend
money to buy furniture for your house. However, you do this indirectly
by paying more rent. In addition, if you plan to stay in that house for
a long time, the furnished house probably won’t make sense.</p>

<p>It is possible to say that as the floor of the house increases, the
rent increases by 1.7%. As a result, the houses in the attic may have
heating problems, which is out of this argument. In addition, you get
away from the noise of the street as the apartment you own is located on
the upper floors. You can have a better view and as long as you are not

<p><img src="p3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>According to the results of the regression, it is possible to say
that the rent increases by approximately 1% as the size of the house
increases.</p>
<p>According to the results of the regression, 4-room houses have a 26%
cheaper rental price than 3-room houses. Although this may seem strange
at first glance, there may be many different reasons behind it. A fact
to consider is that people now generally live alone in big cities and
therefore demand smaller houses. In Ankara/Bahçelievler, where we
obtained some of our data, <a
href="https://secure.sahibinden.com/emlak360/emlak-endeksi/konut/satilik/ankara/59/3409"><strong><em>47%
of the tenants are single</em></strong></a>. Data regarding the marriage
age of women over time shows that in the 1950’s, the earliest age was
19. Compared to today’s time, that age has increased to 25.6. This
indicates that people are now usually single for a longer time, which
can explain higher demand towards homes with less rooms or space. Most
of the 3 room houses in our dataset are in the young building category
(&lt; 15 years). This shows us that the 3 room houses are newer. In
other words, the biggest factor in 3-room houses being more expensive
than 4-room houses is that those houses are newer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vif(model)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Bulunduğu_Kat        Eşyalı          `m²`           Oda         sehir 
##      1.106538      1.059852      2.328053      2.412202      1.040484</code></pre>
<p>There is no multicollinearity problem since all the VIF values less
then 10.</p>
<p>Let’s come to our sharpest conclusion. Houses in Ankara have 45%
lower rental prices than houses in Izmir. There are of course many
reasons for this. We took care to obtain our data from nearby
socioeconomic regions. While we chose the Ümitköy district, where people
with relatively higher incomes live, in Ankara, we also preferred
Denizbostanlısı district, where people with higher incomes live in
İzmir. In addition, we preferred Bahçelievler from Ankara and Nergiz
from İzmir for a relatively lower income demographic. Within the EVDS
database of the CBRT, there can be data found regarding the price index
of housing based on city. By comparing the indexes for Ankara and Izmir,
one can see that Izmir has a higher index, meaning that housing is
usually more expensive compared to Ankara. So, our regression results
are consistent with <a
href="https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/index.php?/evds/serieMarket/#collapse_4"><strong><em>the
CBRT data</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>Both of the two districts we chose from Izmir are very close to the
sea. Some houses even have a direct sea view. This is a factor that
greatly increases the value of the houses. In addition, Denizbostanlısı
and Nergiz İzmir’s most popular and central places; On the other hand,
the places we chose from Ankara are not the most popular places in
Ankara, although it is the center. Here, too, İzmir comes to the fore.
In addition, we have determined that many shopping malls have been
opened in Denizbostanlısı and Nergiz in recent years. This increased the
popularity of the region and increased house prices. These are somewhat
qualitative secondary data. There is an important quantitative situation
that directly affects the outcome of our data. Although the demand of
foreign investors for Ankara is higher than the demand for İzmir, their
demands for İzmir are generally concentrated in this region. There is no
such specific concentration in Ankara. With the increase in demand for
this region, the rent prices of the region are also increasing.</p>
<p>Another finding from our dataset worth mentioning is that the number
of homes with 3 rooms considered to be “new” (genc) exceeds the number
of homes with 4 rooms also considered as new. This can be a potential
explanation as to why properties with fewer rooms can be sold or rented
at a higher price.</p>
<p><img src="p3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>After running our regression of the rent model, we graphed the
distribution of the residuals from our model and compared it to a normal
bell curve to check for the normality of errors. The residual
distribution is shown in black and the normal distribution is in red. As
you can see, the residuals from our model have a similar distribution
compared to the normal curve. The error term from a regression should
have a mean of 0 and the residuals from our rent model have a mean of
2.820906e-18, which is basically 0.</p>
